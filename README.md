This project is brought to you by Enzo Tragnone

This website was originally an assignment given by the University of Toronto to test programming skills in JS. The original assignment success criteria was a front-end program in which a user would be able to go into and answer a series of window prompts and get a randomized password with their desired length.

The functionality of this program has been modified to better demonstrate JS fundamental skills which include a replacement of window prompts with an HTML form submission format for better user flow as well as the option to save desired passwords into Local Memory for future user ability to recall past passwords.
